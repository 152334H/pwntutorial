# ret2shell

This is the first challenge that involves executing /bin/sh. At the very least, completing this challenge requires the know-how to google up "/bin/sh shellcode". 
As an added bonus, new people will be immersed into the idea that stack addresses are always randomised, rather than playing around with toy examples of `aslr off`.

## Sidenote

After this challenge, you may want to attempt pwnable.tw's `start` challenge to make sure that you've understood everything from the first 3 challenges in this repo.
